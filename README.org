Graveyard - the game where 2 necromancers battle raised dead in a graveyard until one of them can no longer move!

This is an implementation of the game [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqi][Banqi]] with a Halloween veneer. 
(currently using banqi role names etc, that may change)



It's currently a work in progress - but has a playable GUI.
 - note: the dimensions are waaay off on windows, possibly Linux.  OSX is fine though.

** Dependencies:
Racket - you can download [[https://download.racket-lang.org][here]]

Run the following to install library dependencies:
 - =raco pkg install memoize=
 - =raco pkg install table-panel=
 
** To play:
 - run: =racket gui.rkt= in this directory

The README will be more filled out as the project becomes more usable.
