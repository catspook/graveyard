Graveyard - the game where 2 necromancers battle raised dead in a graveyard until one of them can no longer move!

This is an implementation of the game [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqi][Banshi]] with a Halloween veneer. 
(currently using banshi role names etc, that may change)


It's currently a work in progress, and is only playable through the repl at the moment, with some manual work.
There is a cli interface that is being worked on to build out functionality, and a GUI planned later.

The README will be more filled out as the project becomes more usable.


** Dependencies:
To install the packages this currently depends on run:
 - raco pkg install memoize
 - raco pkg install table-panel
